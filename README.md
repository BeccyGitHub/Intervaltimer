# Intervaltimer
-------- Aims --------
We want a Main Page (Activity shown when starting the App, if needed) that greets you "Welcome to the Intervaltimer!"
and disappears after 2 (?) seconds. Then on the next page (next activity) one shall be able to enter
- rounds
- interval time
- breakt time
and click on "Start". On the then shown third activity we want to display
- present round
- time running backwards
- break? sth...
We want to play a sound when a round is done ("Yeeeyh you've finished!"/Ringing/"Tooooot!"), although sound tracks take 
memory space and we maybe want to keep the app small in memory. On this activity we also want to be able to pause 
(staying in the present activitiy) and break (going to second activity).
When the training is finished we want to return to the second activity.

Additional features:
- Music (connect with local library or Spotify)
- More sound tracks ("10 sec to go!")
- when app is closed continue and create a bar in the top slide menu
